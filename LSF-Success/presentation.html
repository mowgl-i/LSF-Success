# Before we begin

.pull-left[

Imagine a community of users that talk about coffee and share coffee related content. 

The content can range from a discussion about coffee regions to instructional videos about the coffee making process. With most members using lingo that coffee enthusiasts are familiar with.
This is essentially what a subreddit is!

# What is Livestreamfail

Livestreamfail (LSF) is a subreddit consisting of over 1 million users worldwide. My previous analysis of LSF indicated that the majority of the content posted to LSF were Twitch related. 


--
In fact, most users would agree that most of the content on LSF are ‚ÄòTwitch Clips‚Äô which are highlight portions of a livestream found on Twitch. 


--
[You can compare a Twitch clip to brief highlight of your favorite T.V. show with typed comments by the audience.](https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru/clip/CarefulRoundBurritoKappa-xTLV-KaURdEm9EnR)

--
.pull-left[
A look into LSF will show you that people post Twitch clips, comments on posts and receive karma (points) from upvotes (likes). It's not uncommon, for teams of people use LSF to platform a growing streamer or shed light on an issue within Twitch. This is why understanding how LSF works can give an advantage to streamers, Twitch and sponsors looking to grow a community and build a brand.

A 60 second, short video of the streamer playing a video game. 



Notice the use of emotes in the live chat on the right hand side.

# What are Emotes

What separates ‚Äòlive streaming‚Äô from traditional ‚Äòlive‚Äô TV are the interactions between the viewers and ‚Äòstreamers‚Äô in real-time. The viewers have the ability to chat to the ‚Äòstreamer‚Äô using plain text and emojis.. Or emotes!
Just like emojis, emotes are used to express some sort of emotion. Generally, emotes are used to react to what is being said or shown on the stream. 
But better than emojis, emotes are custom to Twitch and it‚Äôs community.

The Twitch culture have a language using twitch emotes and third-party emotes that cannot be easily interpreted from the visuals themselves.

# Previous Work
.pull-left[

My previous analysis of twitch emotes revealed the possibility of uncovering similar community members based off of emote use alone. Since you could infer the sentiment from a Twitch clip using emotes, what about the sentiment of a community more generally?

This is a network graph connecting two streamers XqC and Forsen by emotes that were they most correlated through their twitch clips featured on LSF. 
 

???
Kind of like finding the similarities between celebrity communities from the emojis community members use.

# But why?

&lt;br&gt;

--
Wouldn‚Äôt you think that a twitch clip that has a lot of ‚ÄòüòÇ‚Äô or more ‚ÄòLULWs‚Äô would do well in a subreddit like Livestreamfail? Recent feedback from LSF on my previous work suggest that is possible!  


&lt;br&gt;
--

&lt;br&gt;
Understanding the power of emotes and the influence that LSF has on the twitch community would be beneficial for growing streamers, company sponsors and Twitch so that they may grow the community and build products.

# How am I doing this

Until now, an R package to navigate the Twitch API to collect chat data from a VOD or Twitch clip did not exist. 

--
.center[
So I built Rchamp to end the frustration an complication of using different languages.

.pull-right[

The main purpose of this package is to enable other useRs to wrangle Twitch chat from Twitch clips (or VODs) into a neat data frame. Unlike some of its python counterparts, it will also return global emotes used, user badge present (1st one), subscribed months, and optional JSON output. 

The package is public and I'm open to contributions!

# Classification: Random Forest

The data was seperated into 'Successful' and 'Not-Successful' categories based off of the score the post recieved. 

&lt;br&gt;
--

Since this has not been done yet, I decided to train a Random Forest model for its simplicity and easy to understand implementation. I deployed hyper-parameter tuning on this model to give the best possible classification results using Area under the Curve (AUC). 

&lt;br&gt;

# Random Forest: Model evaluation

The best possible model that can be derived from this data using RF produces an accuracy of 69.9% and an AUC (Area Under the Curve) score of 59.8%. Sensitivity is 0.94 and Specificity is 0.07. This would suggest that the model is good a predicting which posts are successful(viral), while being not so good at identifying posts that are not successful.

# What did we learn? What was missing?

A very close EDA of the data (also Sensitivity/Specificity) shows that there are more than few posts that contain lots of interactions and emotes but did not gain traction on LSF. 

Emotes alone are not enough! More data is needed about Twitch clips in order to understand why posts go viral. 

--

Some ideas are to include broadcaster, total followers of the broadcaster, total views of the clip, emote + word sentiment scores, and reddit post author. 

Different modeling techniques, both supervised and unsupervised, should be tried.



---
# Next Steps and impacts. 

This project serves the R community, Reddit community and the Twitch community.

**The goal is to understand the power of emotes and the influence that LSF has on the twitch community for growing streamers, company sponsors and Twitch so that they may grow the community and build products.**

Report my findings to folks over at Livestreamfail!

--

It was clear to me that I need more data! Not just the kind of data we grab from an API, but information that can be extracted from what is returned. 

--

There will be more features added to Rchamp to really squeeze out the data tucked away on Reddit and Twitch.

Journal of Open Source Software?

Dashboard-like webapp to bring Rchamp to life!?

# Why the name 'Rchamp'?

It's a play on words from the famous twitch emote PogCamp. This emote is used to express excitement!
