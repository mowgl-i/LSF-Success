# What are Emotes

Like emojis used in standard text messages or on social media, twitch emotes carry some of the same qualities. For example.. (show twtich global emotes here).
(Some flags would be nice.) 


Like sub-cultures on reddit, the Twich culture has develop a language using twitch emotes and third-party emotes that cannot be easily interpreted from the visuals themselves. 

Also, exaterated emotes also exsist and carry diffrent meanings. A perfect example is of the Twitch emote 4Head and it's third-party siblings.

# Busy Chats: Regular vs Trending

# Why am I doing this

Recently, twitch literature has begun characterizing twitch communities through twitch chat, viewership trends, and content but no known projects have used other social platforms outside of twitch to understand how twitch communities manifest and interact with one another using emotes.

This project is to highlight the importance and nuance of twitch emotes in context of their respective communties. Since emotes can be used a important community indicators of X Y Z and much more.

# How am I doing this

Of course we will mostly be using R for this project. I addressed a limitation my previous analysis of LSF by creating an R package to reliably interact with the Twitch Api to gather chat data not yet accomplished in R. 


- Step one: Get reddit link with twich clip url using Bigquery
???
Notes here

--

- Step two: Get chat data from twitch url and gather key-performance indicators
???
and here too

--
 
- Step three: Append emote information to reddit data from link.
--

- Step three.5: Create 'successful/not-successful' criteria for data.
--

- Step four: Split data into testing and training datasets.
--

- Step five: Train and Predict successful/not-successful posts
--

- Step Six: evaluate model performance.

- A by product of this process is now there is a way to remove all twitch tv global emotes and popular 3rd party emotes to access only the text.
